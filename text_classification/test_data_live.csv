     The dairy industry today faces a problem of providing an alternative to adding sweeteners to fermented milk products in order to achieve the desired sweet taste without the added calories. Furthermore, it would be highly advantageous to establish a method for reducing lactose in fermented milk products to a level which is acceptable for lactose-intolerant consumers. The above problems have been solved by providing mutant  Streptococcus thermophilus  strains and mutant  Lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp.  bulgaricus  strains that excrete glucose to the milk when the milk is inoculated and fermented with such  Streptococcus thermophilus  strains and  Lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp,  bulgaricus  strains. Thus, the present invention relates to strains of  Streptococcus thermophilus  and  Lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp,  bulgaricus  which secrete glucose to the milk substrate during fermentation, as well as to mixed cultures comprising the  Streptococcus thermophilus  strains and the  Lactobacillus delbrueckii  subsp,  bulgaricus  strains, starter cultures comprising the strains and dairy products manufactured with the cultures. The present method also relates to use of the strains for decreasing the lactose content of a fermented food product and for boosting growth of the probiotic BB-12®.

     Embodiments of the invention relate to fortified food and dietary supplement products which may be administered to produce desirable physiological improvement. In particular, embodiments of the invention relates to the administration of products enhanced with plant products and iridoids. A study was performed to evaluate the iridoid content, as well as the in vitro and in vivo bioactivities, of a beverage containing noni fruit, Cornelian cherries, and olive leaf extract. The major iridoids present were identified as asperulosidic acid, deacetylasperulosidic acid, oleuropein, morroniside, loganic acid, and loganin In the 2,2-Diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay, remarkably high in vitro antioxidant activity was observed, with an IC 50  of 3.8 μL/mL. In vivo bioactivities were evaluated in type 2 diabetic Sprague Dawley rats. In a dose-dependent manner, the composition reduced abnormal weight gain, blood glucose levels, and serum advanced glycation end products (AGEs), as well as improved immunity via increased T cell counts and CD4+/CD8 +  ratios.

     An automated driving system for an autonomous vehicle may include a perception system and a computing device for detecting and tracking a location of an object within an obstructed viewing region blocked from view of sensors associated with the perception system. The computing device and perception system may identify an obstructed viewing region and detect an external imaging assist device located within a sensor field of the perception system. The imaging assist device is capable of transmitting images of the obstructed viewing region to the perception system. The computing device analyzes the images received from the imaging assist device for purposes of detecting an object within the obstructed viewing region and tracking its location relative to the autonomous vehicle. The computing device may transmit a command to an autonomous vehicle system to implement an autonomous vehicle maneuver based at least in part on the tracked location of the hidden object.

     Apparatuses, systems, and methods for the deployment of a plurality of autonomous underwater seismic vehicles (AUVs) on or near the seabed based on acoustic communications with an underwater vehicle, such as a remotely operated vehicle. In an embodiment, the underwater vehicle is lowered from a surface vessel along with a subsea station with a plurality of AUVs. The AUVs are configured to acoustically communicate with the underwater vehicle or a second surface vessel for deployment and retrieval operations. The underwater vehicle and/or second surface vessel is configured to instruct the AUVs to leave the subsea station or underwater vehicle and to travel to their intended seabed destination. The underwater vehicle and/or second surface vessel is also configured to selectively instruct the AUVs to leave the seabed and return to a seabed location and/or a subsea station for retrieval.

     A least restrictive allowable driving state of a semi-autonomous driving system is determined based on one or more threats and sensor performance. A current driving state and a future driving state are determined based on an attention state and a steering state of a driver. Warnings are provided to the driver in order to match the current driving state to the future driving state. Driver interaction and attention are enforced when the driver does not respond to the warnings.
