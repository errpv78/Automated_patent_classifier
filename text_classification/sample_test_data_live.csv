     In an autonomously responsive laminate formed by sealing an isotropic aqueous solution, in which the polysaccharide derivative dissolved in water aggregates due to a temperature rise to cause the cloudy scattering thereof to occur, in a cell at least part of which is transparent and through which this aqueous solution can be seen directly, the isotropic aqueous solution consists of a solution obtained by dissolving 100 parts by weight of polysaccharide derivative of weight average molecular weight of about 10,000-200,000 in about 110-2,000 parts by weight of a water medium composed of water the quantity of which corresponds to about 25-450 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the polysaccharide derivative and amphipathic substance. This laminate can be manufactured by sealing an isotropic aqueous solution in a cell which is transparent at at least a part thereof, and which permits the aqueous solution to be seen directly therethrough, and it can be used advantageously as a window.
